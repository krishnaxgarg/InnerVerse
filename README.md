# Mindy

Mindy is a project aiming at improving the mental health condition of the masses, which deteriorated during the COVID pandemic due to a lack of interaction. We are aware of how humans are social animals, hungry for attention and craving friendships. Mindy provides you a platform to check your scale of mental well-being. That's our ultimate aim at Mindy.

## About Us

Mindy is a non-profit movement empowering awareness for mental health among people. It is created to inform individuals about their mental condition and provide them with consultancy from a doctor. This is not a site for personal disclosure of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. If you are in crisis, please call 112/911 or go to your nearest emergency department for assistance.
